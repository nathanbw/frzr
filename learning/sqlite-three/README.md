# sqlite-three
---
This repo is all about trying to learn how to use the `sqlite` crate in rust

### 2022-07-24 (First day) Ideas
* Can we make the schema creation prettier by shipping the schema as `.sql` files instead of hiding it in raw strings in the source?
* Should we unwrap, `?`, or do explicit error handling?
* What about the whole string vs BLOB thing?
* Do we want to make structs to represent `file_entry`s?
* `sqlite` seems like the lowest-common-denominator crate. Should we give other ones a look?
